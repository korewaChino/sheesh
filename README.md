Democratize Cornering the Market.

`sheesh` is a work-in-progress open-source scalper/autobuy bot in TypeScript meant to be accessible to everyone.

Most scalper bots are paid and cost around several thousands of dollars each, even more than the item you wanted to buy. We plan to create a fully free, user-friendly and accessible auto-buyer for everyone. I mean it's not cheating if everyone does it, right?

Buy your Sneakers, Consoles, and GPUs faster than anyone else with `sheesh`! ðŸ˜©ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘ˆ
